First get user input mainly infinetly through "For loop"
We use a generator expresions to yeild the result
    we get the 2 interrupts mainly when designing the interpretor
       KeyboardError crt+ C and EndOfFile (EOF) crt +D


=====
    THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PYTHON CODE:

        STATEMENTS "Which does'nt Evaluate"  =={exec}
        EXPRESSIONS "Which does some evaluation and Return" =={eval}

--->
    if user_input is a Expression:
        Return eval
    else:
        Return exec

In order to check a user_input is an Expression we just compile it into python bytecode using a compile(){function}
    and then return eval if it succeds..
